# ðŸ“„ Document: GenAI Q&A Engine Project Plan



---

# ðŸ“Œ **Project Title:**

Private Q&A Engine using LangChain, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, and Phi-3

---

# ðŸ“Œ **Project Objective:**

Develop a **private, document-based Q&A engine** that can ingest organizational documents,  
and allow users to **ask natural language questions** to retrieve **contextual, accurate answers**.

---

# ðŸ“Œ **Key Outcomes:**

- **Self-contained document retrieval + AI answer generation system**.

- **Offline/local deployable solution** â€” no external API dependency for LLM.

- **Structured, scalable, and secure foundation** for future extensions (like multi-docs, citations, web interface).

---

# ðŸ“Œ **Scope of the Initial Version (MVP):**

âœ… Text-based documents ingestion (TXT files).  
âœ… Text chunking and intelligent splitting (Recursive Strategy).  
âœ… Embedding and storing chunks in a local ChromaDB database.  
âœ… Lightweight Phi-3 language model to generate human-like answers.  
âœ… Command-line interface for querying (no frontend initially).  
âœ… Support for iterative improvement and extensions after MVP.

# ðŸ“Œ **Implementation Phases:**

---

## **Phase 1: Environment and Setup**

- Install Python environment.

- Install libraries:
  
  - LangChain
  
  - ChromaDB
  
  - Sentence-Transformers
  
  - Transformers
  
  - Accelerate

- Set up project folder structure:
  
  - `data/` â€” to store documents,
  
  - `chroma_db/` â€” to persist vector storage.

---

## **Phase 2: Document Ingestion and Preparation**

- Collect source documents (start with `.txt` format).

- Load documents using LangChain DocumentLoader.

- Apply RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter:
  
  - Chunk size: 500 characters,
  
  - Overlap: 50 characters.

---

## **Phase 3: Embedding and Vector Storage**

- Embed all text chunks using the Sentence Transformers model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).

- Store embeddings into ChromaDB for fast vector similarity search.

Key notes:

- Persist vector database for reuse across sessions.

- Manage documents' metadata (optional for future citation features).

---

## **Phase 4: Model Loading and Orchestration**

- Load the Phi-3 LLM locally using Huggingface Transformers.

- Wrap model into a LangChain-compatible LLM object.

Key configuration:

- Set maximum tokens generated (e.g., 512).

- Device map auto (auto allocate to CPU/GPU).

---

## **Phase 5: Retrieval and QA Chain Setup**

- Set up a Retriever object:
  
  - Search top 2â€“3 most similar document chunks.

- Build a RetrievalQA chain:
  
  - Retriever + LLM pipeline integration.
  
  - "Stuff" chain type for simplicity (send retrieved docs directly to LLM).

---

## **Phase 6: Simple Interaction Layer**

- Command-line interaction:
  
  - Prompt user for a question,
  
  - Send to retrieval chain,
  
  - Display generated answer.

Scope:

- Keep interaction minimal,

- Focus on retrieval quality and answer relevance.

---

## **Phase 7: Testing and Validation**

- Test system by asking domain-relevant questions.

- Check:
  
  - Factual correctness,
  
  - Relevance to source documents,
  
  - Fluency of generated answers.

Validation Metrics:

- Answer Relevance (measured manually in v1),

- Hallucination Rate (manually check for invented information),

- Response Time (observational for local model performance).

---

## **Phase 8: Iterative Improvements**

- Tune chunk size and overlap if retrieval quality is poor.

- Adjust top_k retrieval parameter (number of chunks fetched).

- If answers are incomplete, adjust max_tokens during model setup.
