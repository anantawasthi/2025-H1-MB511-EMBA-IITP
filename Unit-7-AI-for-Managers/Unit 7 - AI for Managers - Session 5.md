## ðŸ”¹ Chart 1: Bar Chart

**Use Case**: Compare the number of employees across departments.



```python
# Importing required libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the synthetic HR dataset (assumed file name)
df = pd.read_excel('Synthetic_HR_Dataset.xlsx', sheet_name='Employee_Master')

# --- Initial Exploration ---

# Show first 5 rows of data
print(df.head())

# Check the unique values in Department column
print("Departments:", df['Department'].unique())

# Count number of employees per department
department_counts = df['Department'].value_counts()
print("Employee count by Department:\n", department_counts)

# --- Bar Chart ---

"""
Bar Chart:
This chart is used to display the count of employees across different departments.
It helps managers quickly see which departments are large or small.
"""

# Plotting the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))  # Set the chart size
department_counts.plot(kind='bar')  # Create bar chart from value counts

# Add title and axis labels
plt.title('Employee Count by Department')
plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.ylabel('Number of Employees')

# Show the chart
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

### ðŸ§  Explanation:

- **Why this chart**: A bar chart is ideal for comparing sizes of categoriesâ€”in this case, departments.

- **Interpretation**: Taller bars = more employees. You can identify staffing gaps or resource-heavy areas.

- **Limitations**: Doesnâ€™t show proportions directly (a pie chart would help there).

- **Alternatives**: Pie chart, horizontal bar chart.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chart 2: **Pie Chart** â€“ *Proportion of Gender in the Workforce*

```python
# --- Initial Exploration for Gender Distribution ---

# Check unique gender values
print("Unique Genders:", df['Gender'].unique())

# Count of employees by gender
gender_counts = df['Gender'].value_counts()
print("Employee count by Gender:\n", gender_counts)

# --- Pie Chart ---

"""
Pie Chart:
This chart shows the proportion of employees by gender.
Useful for diversity reporting or gender equity assessments.
"""

# Plotting pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.pie(gender_counts, labels=gender_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)

# Add title
plt.title('Gender Distribution in Workforce')

# Display the chart
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Interpretation:

- Gives a clear idea of **proportional representation**

- Great for **diversity insights**

- Less effective with **too many categories**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chart 3: **Histogram** â€“ *Distribution of Employee Ages*

```python
# --- Initial Exploration for Age Column ---

# Check for nulls and summary
print("Missing Age values:", df['Age'].isnull().sum())
print("Age Summary:\n", df['Age'].describe())

# --- Histogram ---

"""
Histogram:
This chart helps visualize the distribution of a numeric variableâ€”in this case, employee ages.
Useful for understanding age demographics and planning generational policies.
"""

# Plotting histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.hist(df['Age'], bins=10, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')

# Add labels and title
plt.title('Age Distribution of Employees')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Display the chart
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Interpretation:

- Shows **concentration** of age groups (e.g., younger vs. older workforce)

- Helps identify skewness or outliers

- Ideal for **continuous numeric variables**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chart 4: **Box Plot** â€“ *Salary Distribution by Department*

```python
import seaborn as sns

# --- Initial Exploration ---

# Check data types and basic info
print(df[['Department', 'MonthlySalary']].info())

# Check for outliers
print(df.groupby('Department')['MonthlySalary'].describe())

# --- Box Plot ---

"""
Box Plot:

plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.ylabel('Monthly Salary')

# Rotate x-axis labels if needed
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

# Display the chart
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Interpretation:

- Reveals **median salary**, **interquartile range**, and **outliers**

- Departments with wider boxes = more salary variation

- Can expose **inequities or pay structure gaps**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chart 5: **Line Chart** â€“ *Monthly New Hires Trend*

```python
# --- Initial Exploration for Joining Dates ---

# Ensure 'DateOfJoining' is datetime
df['DateOfJoining'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DateOfJoining'])
