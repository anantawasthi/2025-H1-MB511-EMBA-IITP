## üß± **7. Stacked Bar Chart**

---

### üìò **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Stacked Bar Chart** is an extension of the standard bar chart where each bar is **divided into segments**, with each segment representing a **sub-category** of the total. These segments are stacked on top of one another, enabling both **individual subgroup values** and the **total cumulative value** to be visualized simultaneously.

This type of chart is extremely useful when you want to show **how parts make up a whole across categories**, while still allowing for **comparisons of the total**. It‚Äôs a popular visualization in **financial reporting, operations, and survey analytics**, where both **category-wise totals** and **subgroup dynamics** need to be communicated effectively.

---

### üßæ **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- One **categorical variable** for the main category (e.g., time period, department)

- One or more **categorical subgroup variables** (e.g., product, gender, region)

- One **numerical variable** (e.g., revenue, counts, percentages)

### üîç **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- The **entire height** of each bar represents the **total value** for that category.

- Each **colored segment** within a bar represents a **subgroup's contribution**.

- The **relative height of segments** shows how much each subgroup contributes.

- Comparing **segment size across bars** helps identify trends or patterns.

- Comparing **total bar height** shows changes in overall volume or scale.

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- When showing **total values along with subgroup contributions**.

- To display **composition changes over time** or across groups.

- For use in **dashboards, reports, or financial summaries**.

- When **comparing how parts contribute to a whole across categories**.

- Ideal for **HR headcount analysis, budget tracking, or project allocation**.

---

### ‚ùå **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- When there are **many subgroups**, making the chart difficult to read.

- If **precise subgroup comparison** is needed ‚Äî use a grouped bar chart instead.

- When parts of a whole are not important ‚Äî a standard bar chart may suffice.

- If subgroups are **very small or highly variable**, they can be lost in stacking.

---

### üîÑ **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Grouped Bar Chart** ‚Äì better for side-by-side subgroup comparison.

- **100% Stacked Bar Chart** ‚Äì focuses on relative percentage contribution.

- **Pie Chart or Donut Chart** ‚Äì good for simple part-to-whole comparisons.

- **Treemap** ‚Äì ideal for visualizing hierarchical composition.

### üíº **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **Sales by Product and Region**: Track total sales across quarters, segmented by product category.

2. **HR Workforce Analysis**: Show employee count split by department and job level.

3. **Budget Allocation by Function**: Visualize how spending is divided across expense types within each department.

4. **Survey Responses by Demographic**: Display how responses vary across age or location groups.

5. **Website Traffic Composition**: Show total visits by channel (e.g., direct, referral, organic) across months.

### üßæ **9. Closing Summary**

The **Stacked Bar Chart** excels at combining **compositional analysis with overall trend insight**, making it a valuable tool for multi-dimensional categorical data. It lets you understand both the **whole picture and the individual components**, supporting complex storytelling in a single, space-efficient format.

However, clarity depends heavily on **design discipline**‚Äîtoo many segments or inconsistent color schemes can undermine readability. When used effectively, stacked bar charts deliver both depth and clarity in one visual.
