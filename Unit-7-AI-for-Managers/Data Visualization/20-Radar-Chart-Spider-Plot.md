## 🕸️ **20. Radar Chart (Spider Plot)**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Radar Chart**, also known as a **Spider Plot or Web Chart**, is a circular chart used to **compare multiple quantitative variables across a single entity or multiple entities**. Each variable is represented along a separate axis starting from the center, and data points are connected to form a polygon. The shape and area of the polygon visually convey strengths, weaknesses, and balance across dimensions.

Radar charts are particularly effective for displaying **performance, competency scores, or multi-attribute comparisons**, and are often seen in **HR evaluations, product scoring, marketing analysis**, and **sports performance reviews**.

### 🧾 **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- A set of **labeled metrics or categories** (e.g., innovation, quality, speed)

- A corresponding set of **numerical values** for each label

- Optional: **Multiple groups/entities** to overlay for comparison

### 🔍 **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- Each **axis** represents a variable.

- The **distance from the center** shows the magnitude of that variable.

- The **shape of the polygon** indicates how evenly balanced the performance is.

- **Larger area** means stronger performance overall.

- When multiple groups are plotted, overlapping areas help **visualize comparison**.

---

### ✅ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- When comparing **multiple metrics for a single entity**.

- To display **performance or skill profiles**.

- For visualizing **survey or evaluation scores** across categories.

- In dashboards for **team KPIs or capability matrices**.

- When communicating **strengths, gaps, and trade-offs** in a compact format.

---

### ❌ **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- If you have **too many variables** – leads to clutter and loss of readability.

- When you need to compare **exact values** – bar or line charts are more precise.

- If your audience is **not familiar with radar plots**, they may misinterpret them.

- When the number of entities being compared is **very large**.

---

### 🔄 **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Bar Chart** – clearer when comparing across fewer metrics.

- **Heatmap** – for a matrix-style comparison across entities and attributes.

- **Dot Plot** – when comparing a few values with precise scales.

- **Small Multiples** – one chart per entity for side-by-side comparison.

### 💼 **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **Employee Skills Assessment**: Visualize an individual’s proficiency across technical and soft skills.

2. **Product Feature Benchmarking**: Compare how products score on innovation, usability, performance, etc.

3. **Team KPI Summary**: Showcase operational performance across speed, quality, cost, and efficiency.

4. **Competitor Analysis**: Evaluate how different brands fare on customer satisfaction, pricing, and reach.

5. **Athlete Performance Profiles**: Visualize agility, strength, speed, and endurance in sports science.

### 🧾 **9. Closing Summary**

The **Radar Chart** is an elegant solution for **multi-metric visualization**, especially when the goal is to emphasize **balance, profile shape**, or **comparative performance** across several dimensions. When well-designed and limited to a manageable number of axes, radar charts can tell compelling stories—highlighting **gaps, dominance, and opportunities** in a single glance.

Perfect for strategic assessments and team evaluations, radar charts bring data to life when you're juggling **multifaceted performance indicators**.
