## 🌲 **11. Treemap**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Treemap** is a space-efficient visualization used to represent **hierarchical data** as a set of **nested rectangles**, where the size of each rectangle reflects a **quantitative variable**. It is especially useful for visualizing **proportional data** in a compact format while also displaying **hierarchical groupings**.

Each rectangle represents a category, and if the data is nested (multi-level), the rectangles are further subdivided to reflect **subcategories**. Treemaps are frequently used in **budget analysis, disk usage, organizational charts, and portfolio distribution**, offering a birds-eye view of complex datasets.

### 🧾 **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- A **hierarchical or categorical variable** (e.g., category, sub-category)

- A **numerical variable** (e.g., budget, size, frequency)

### 🔍 **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- Each **rectangle** represents a **category**, and its **area reflects its value**.

- Larger rectangles mean **higher values**.

- **Colors** are often used to differentiate categories or encode a second variable (e.g., performance).

- **Labels** inside rectangles show category names and possibly percentages or values.

- Treemaps help identify **dominant segments** and compare **relative sizes** visually.

### ✅ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- When visualizing **how resources or values are divided** within a hierarchy.

- To display **budget allocations**, **market share**, or **portfolio composition**.

- For showing **nested relationships** in a limited space.

- When conveying both **scale and structure** is important.

- Ideal for **dashboards, reports, and executive summaries**.

---

### ❌ **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- If the dataset has **many small categories** — they may be hard to read.

- When **exact numerical comparison** is required — use bar or column charts.

- If the audience isn’t familiar with treemaps — may require explanation.

- When **hierarchical relationships** are not meaningful — consider a simpler composition chart.

---

### 🔄 **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Stacked Bar Chart** – to show composition with clearer category distinctions.

- **Pie or Donut Chart** – for fewer, flat categories.

- **Sunburst Chart** – for radial hierarchical visualization.

- **Waffle Chart** – as a grid-based alternative for part-to-whole relationships.

### 💼 **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **Annual Budget Allocation**: Show how a company allocates its total budget across departments and sub-departments.

2. **Website Page Visits**: Visualize which sections of a website receive the most traffic.

3. **Portfolio Distribution**: Display asset allocation in investment portfolios by class and sub-class.

4. **Project Effort Breakdown**: Analyze how total hours are split across teams and project phases.

5. **Sales by Region and Country**: Understand which countries contribute most to regional sales performance.

### 🧾 **9. Closing Summary**

The **Treemap** offers a powerful way to explore **relative proportions** and **hierarchical relationships** within a dataset in a compact, visual-first format. It's especially valuable when you're working with **space constraints** or large sets of nested categories.

While they require thoughtful design and sometimes audience education, treemaps shine when the goal is to **visualize structure, dominance, and contribution** across various levels of data. When paired with interactivity or filtering, they can become dynamic tools for decision-making.
