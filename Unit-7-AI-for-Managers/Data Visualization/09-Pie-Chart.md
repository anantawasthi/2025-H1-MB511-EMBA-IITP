## 🥧 **9. Pie Chart**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Pie Chart** is a classic and widely recognized chart used to display **part-to-whole relationships**. The circle represents a **100% total**, and each slice of the pie illustrates the **proportion** of a category relative to that whole. Simple to understand and visually appealing, pie charts are a staple in **business reporting, presentations, and dashboards**.

Despite their popularity, pie charts are most effective when the number of categories is **limited** and the differences in proportions are **significant**. While not ideal for analytical precision, they excel at **communicating general proportions quickly** to non-technical audiences.

### 🧾 **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- One **categorical variable** (e.g., product type, region, channel)

- One **numerical variable** representing proportion or percentage (e.g., revenue share, count, percentage)

### 🔍 **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- Each **slice** of the pie represents a category’s **contribution to the total**.

- The **size of the slice** (angle and area) reflects the proportion.

- Labels and **percentage values** help clarify each category’s share.

- You can quickly identify the **largest and smallest categories**.

- Not effective for precise comparison between slices of **similar size**.

---

### ✅ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- When you want to show **relative proportions of a small number of categories**.

- For **executive summaries or dashboards** where simplicity is key.

- When **part-to-whole relationships** matter more than raw values.

- Ideal for visualizing **budget breakdowns, product share, or demographic segments**.

- When targeting a **non-technical or presentation-oriented audience**.

---

### ❌ **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- When there are **more than 5–6 categories** – the chart becomes cluttered and hard to interpret.

- If **precision** or detailed comparison between segments is needed.

- When categories have **similar proportions**, making visual differentiation difficult.

- For **time-series data** – use line or area charts instead.

- If the audience needs to compare exact values — bar charts work better.

---

### 🔄 **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Bar Chart** – more effective when comparing values across categories.

- **Donut Chart** – a modern alternative to pie charts with better visual balance.

- **Treemap** – useful for representing hierarchical part-to-whole data.

- **Stacked Bar Chart** – for showing proportions with category context.

### 💼 **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **Market Share by Brand**: Display the percentage of total sales by brand in a product category.

2. **Budget Allocation**: Show how a company distributes its annual budget across departments.

3. **Website Traffic Sources**: Visualize the share of traffic from search, social, direct, and referral channels.

4. **Customer Demographics**: Illustrate gender or age group composition.

5. **Expense Composition**: Show a breakdown of fixed vs. variable business expenses.

### 🧾 **9. Closing Summary**

The **Pie Chart** is a simple, visually engaging chart that excels at conveying **part-to-whole relationships** with just a glance. When used judiciously—especially with fewer, distinct categories—it can effectively highlight **distribution, share, and proportionality** in an easy-to-understand format.

However, its limitations in precision and scalability mean it should be used primarily for **overview-level storytelling** rather than detailed comparison. For maximum clarity, always label slices and limit the number of segments.
