## 🍩 **10. Donut Chart**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Donut Chart** is a variant of the pie chart, differentiated by the **circular blank space in the center**. This visual tweak makes the chart more modern and versatile, allowing room for labels, icons, or even total values at the center. Like the pie chart, it is used to display **part-to-whole relationships** but tends to be more visually balanced and easier to read when designed well.

Donut charts are particularly popular in **dashboards, executive summaries, and reports**, as they blend aesthetic appeal with functionality. They maintain the simplicity of pie charts while **minimizing visual distortion** often caused by pie slices.

### 🧾 **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- One **categorical variable** (e.g., cost center, segment, user type)

- One **numerical variable** representing a proportion or share (e.g., % of budget, user count)

### 🔍 **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- The **outer ring** represents the **proportional size** of each category.

- **Labels and percentages** (usually outside or inside the slices) give more details.

- The **central blank space** can display text such as total values or KPIs.

- Works similarly to a pie chart, but with enhanced **readability and aesthetics**.

---

### ✅ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- When visualizing **part-to-whole relationships** in a cleaner, modern format.

- For **dashboards** where you want to highlight a metric in the center.

- In **presentations or infographics**, to grab attention while conveying proportions.

- To **compare shares across a few categories** in a visually engaging way.

- When you want to integrate **qualitative text (e.g., totals or highlights)** at the center.

---

### ❌ **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- When you have **more than 5–6 categories** – readability suffers.

- If you're aiming for **precise quantitative comparisons** – bar charts are better.

- When proportions are **too similar**, making slices hard to distinguish.

- If space is constrained and **labels or legends are critical**.

---

### 🔄 **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Pie Chart** – a simpler variant without a central hole.

- **Stacked Bar Chart** – clearer for comparing multiple proportions across groups.

- **Treemap** – useful for more complex or hierarchical proportions.

- **Waffle Chart** – another creative way to show part-to-whole relationships.

### 💼 **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **App Usage by Feature**: Display the usage share of different app modules.

2. **Revenue by Product Segment**: Visualize revenue contributions in a SaaS dashboard.

3. **Expense Distribution in Budget Reports**: Showcase major vs. minor expense heads.

4. **User Demographic Split**: Show the percentage of users by gender, device, or platform.

5. **Support Ticket Categories**: Highlight what type of issues make up most customer complaints.

### 🧾 **9. Closing Summary**

The **Donut Chart** is a sleek, modern tool for presenting **part-to-whole relationships**, especially when a clean design is as important as the data. Its central hole not only enhances aesthetic appeal but provides space for **contextual elements** like KPIs or category labels.

While it shares the limitations of pie charts—especially when overused or cluttered—it performs exceptionally well in **dashboard visuals, one-page summaries**, and **high-level insights**. When used purposefully, the donut chart can elevate both the look and clarity of your visualizations.
