## 🏞️ **12. Stacked Area Chart**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Stacked Area Chart** is a time-series visualization that shows how multiple numeric series **contribute to a total over time**. Each series is represented by a colored area, “stacked” on top of one another so the height of the area indicates the cumulative value at each point. It’s a great way to observe both **individual trends and total growth** simultaneously.

Stacked area charts are particularly valuable when you want to show how parts of a whole evolve over a continuous axis (usually time), helping in identifying **dominance, contribution shifts**, or **trend overlays** across components.

### 🧾 **2. What Kind of Fields Are Needed to Construct the Chart**

- One **continuous or time-based variable** (e.g., years, months, quarters)

- Multiple **numerical series**, each representing a different group or category

### 🔍 **4. How to Interpret the Chart**

- The **X-axis** shows time or another continuous metric.

- The **Y-axis** shows the cumulative total of all stacked values.

- Each **colored area** represents a category’s **contribution** to the total.

- **Thickness of each layer** at any point in time indicates the category’s magnitude.

- Helps identify **rising or falling trends** across multiple categories.

---

### ✅ **5. Best Scenario to Use This Chart**

- To visualize how **categories evolve over time** and contribute to a total.

- When showing **market share**, **revenue breakdown**, or **resource utilization**.

- For **monitoring portfolio shifts** or KPI drivers.

- Ideal for **dashboards, operational reviews**, and **trend presentations**.

- When total value and part contributions are both important.

---

### ❌ **6. When Not to Use This Chart**

- If the categories have **high variability** — interpretation becomes harder.

- When you have **too many series** — the chart may become cluttered.

- For datasets without a **continuous variable** — this chart is inappropriate.

- When **precise individual values** matter more than visual trends — use a line chart.

---

### 🔄 **7. Alternatives to This Chart**

- **Line Chart** – to compare trends without stacking.

- **Stacked Bar Chart** – for part-to-whole comparisons at discrete time points.

- **Stream Graph** – for smoother, more artistic stacked area representations.

- **100% Stacked Area Chart** – to focus on relative proportions over time.

### 💼 **8. Five Practical Use Cases**

1. **Revenue by Product Line Over Time**: Track contributions of each product to total revenue.

2. **Website Traffic by Source**: Visualize how different channels contribute to site visits monthly.

3. **Energy Consumption by Source**: Show how electricity, gas, and solar contribute to total usage.

4. **Employee Headcount Growth**: View department-wise hiring patterns over the years.

5. **Investment Portfolio Value**: Analyze value contribution of asset classes over time.

### 🧾 **9. Closing Summary**

The **Stacked Area Chart** blends trend analysis with composition insights, making it a strong candidate for **longitudinal storytelling** where total value and component changes both matter. It gives a **layered perspective** on how individual series influence the whole, especially across **time-based metrics**.

That said, careful design and a limited number of series are key to maintaining readability. When well-executed, stacked area charts can be powerful tools for highlighting **growth patterns, dominance, and category interplay**.
