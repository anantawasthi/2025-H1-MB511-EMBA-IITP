## 📊 **5. Bar Chart**

---

### 📘 **1. Introduction to the Chart**

A **Bar Chart** is one of the most widely used and intuitive types of visualizations for displaying **categorical data**. It presents data using **rectangular bars**, where the **length or height** of each bar corresponds to the value or frequency of that category. The bars can be plotted **vertically or horizontally**, and can be arranged in any order—alphabetical, by frequency, or grouped for comparison.

Bar charts are highly versatile and are used across nearly all industries for **reporting, dashboards, business intelligence, and exploratory analysis**. Their simplicity and readability make them especially effective for non-technical audiences. Whether you're comparing product sales, survey responses, or counts of events, bar charts offer a **clear snapshot of categorical data relationships**.
