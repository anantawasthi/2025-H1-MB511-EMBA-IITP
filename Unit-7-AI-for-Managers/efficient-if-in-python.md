# ‚úÖ **Writing `if` Statements Like a Pro in Python**

Whether you‚Äôre managing business logic, building dashboards, or designing automation rules, writing clean and effective `if` statements is key to Python mastery. Below are the **best practices, power tips, and style improvements** to write `if` statements like a seasoned Pythonista.

---

## üß† 1. **Keep Conditions Simple and Readable**

### ‚ùå Avoid:

```python
if (score > 50 and score < 100):
```

### ‚úÖ Do:

```python
if 50 < score < 100:
```

üîç Python supports **chained comparisons**, making your code cleaner and more readable‚Äîespecially for range checks.

---

## üßπ 2. **Use `elif` Instead of Nested `if`**

### ‚ùå Avoid:

```python
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
else:
    if grade >= 80:
        print("B")
```

### ‚úÖ Do:

```python
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
```

üìå Nesting makes the logic harder to follow. Use `elif` to make mutually exclusive conditions clear.

---

## üéØ 3. **Prioritize the Most Likely Conditions First**

Put the most frequently satisfied condition at the top to **improve performance and clarity**.

```python
if customer_type == "Premium":
    handle_premium()
elif customer_type == "Regular":
    handle_regular()
else:
    handle_guest()
```

This helps both the interpreter and your team understand the primary use case.

---

## üéØ 4. **Avoid Redundant Conditions**

### ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Do This:

```python
if is_active == True:
    print("User is active")
```

### ‚úÖ Just Do:

```python
if is_active:
    print("User is active")
```

‚úîÔ∏è Boolean variables don‚Äôt need explicit comparison with `True` or `False`. They're already either true or false.

---

## üßº 5. **Use Meaningful Variable Names for Self-Explanatory Logic**

### ‚ùå Don‚Äôt:

```python
if x:
    do_something()
```

### ‚úÖ Better:

```python
if payment_successful:
    send_receipt()
```

Good variable names make your `if` logic read like English.

---

## üß≠ 6. **Use `not` for Inverse Logic, But Carefully**

```python
if not is_approved:
    print("Waiting for approval")
```

üß† Prefer positive checks when possible‚Äîthey‚Äôre easier to mentally process.

---

## üîÅ 7. **Use Dictionaries Instead of Long `if-elif` Chains (Advanced)**

### Instead of:

```python
if role == "admin":
    dashboard = "Admin Dashboard"
elif role == "user":
    dashboard = "User Dashboard"
else:
    dashboard = "Guest Dashboard"
```

### Do:

```python
dashboards = {
    "admin": "Admin Dashboard",
    "user": "User Dashboard"
}
dashboard = dashboards.get(role, "Guest Dashboard")
```

‚ö° This improves scalability and is easier to maintain with many roles.

---

## üö´ 8. **Avoid Empty `if` Blocks ‚Äì Use `pass` if Needed**

```python
if audit_mode:
    pass  # Placeholder: logic will be added later
```

Python throws an error if a block is empty‚Äî`pass` acts as a legal placeholder.

---

## üîÑ 9. **Use `is` for `None`, Not `==`**

```python
# Correct
if value is None:
    handle_missing()

# Incorrect
if value == None:  # works but not recommended
```

`is None` is the Pythonic way to check for null/missing values.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. **Keep It Clean and Consistent**

Stick to these:

- Use `4-space indentation`

- Add spacing for readability:

```python
if salary > 50000:
    print("Bonus Eligible")
```

Not:

```python
if(salary>50000):print("Bonus Eligible")
```

---

## üéÅ Bonus: `if` One-Liners (Use Sparingly)

```python
print("Approved") if status == "OK" else print("Pending")
```

‚úÖ Use for quick expressions  
‚ùå Avoid for complex logic‚Äîit reduces clarity
