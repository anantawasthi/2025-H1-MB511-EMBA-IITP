Below is a **curated list of datasets** (free and publicly available) that are ideal for applying all the principles from **Chapters 1 to 7 of Feature Engineering**. Each dataset supports:

- **Feature Creation** (Categorical, Continuous, Date/Time),

- **Feature Selection** (statistical and model-based),

- **Data Splitting** (random, time-based, stratified),

- **Managerial decision framing** (e.g., customer segmentation, attrition, churn, credit scoring).

## üí° Tips for Application in MB511 Context:

- Use **HR Attrition, Loan, and Churn datasets** in class assignments to simulate managerial interpretation of features.

- Run full pipelines on **Online Retail II** or **Superstore** to showcase end-to-end feature design, selection, and temporal validation.

- Consider building a **feature register** and **importance dashboard** using outputs from tree-based models for internal presentations.
